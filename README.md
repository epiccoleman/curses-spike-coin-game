# Curses

This repo is for messing around with the Ruby bindings for Curses.

[Tutorial](https://stac47.github.io/ruby/curses/tutorial/2014/01/21/ruby-and-curses-tutorial.html)

So, this sort of evolved into a little game. It works fine. Not exactly like, fun, but it's a good proof of concept. 

It should have some tests and be, you know, organized, but it kinda got away from me as I was spiking out how the Curses bindings worked. This is fun, more to come.

To play game, clone this repo, then run `bundle install && bundle exec ruby curses.rb`.
